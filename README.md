# StockWatch

A program that utilizes webscraping to grab financial data from Yahoo! Finance and sends push notifications to users to help with stock monitoring and day trading.

## Project Description

StockWatch was developed as a tool to enhance investment strategies and optimize day trading activities. By entering just the stock symbol, the program will display the stockâ€™s current price and price difference (from the closing bid) by using real-time data. After which, one is able to set custom price thresholds (price ceilings or price floors) for their selected stock. The program will then monitor the real-time price movements and when it crosses the selected price threshold, it will instantly send a push notification to alert the user about the event.

## Inspiration

As a budding investor, I wanted to develop a tool that would not only assist me but also fellow investors in optimizing their day-to-day investment strategies. Navigating market trends, analyzing stock performances, and making time-crucial decisions can be overwhelming for a beginner. Hence, by combining my technical skills in programming with an interest in the financial stock market and my passion for creative problem-solving, developing this program has been incredibly rewarding.
